"Create a modern, interactive, and fully responsive web component or application using only HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Adhere strictly to the following guidelines:

Technology Stack

Core Technologies: Only use vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
No Backend: Avoid server-side frameworks (Node.js, PHP, etc.) or external libraries (React, Vue, etc.) unless explicitly requested.
Icons: Use Font Awesome via CDN if icons are needed.
UI/UX Standards

Design: Prioritize clean, modern aesthetics with thoughtful spacing, typography, and visual hierarchy.
Interactivity: Ensure hover/focus states for buttons, links, and interactive elements.
Accessibility:
Semantic HTML (<nav>, <section>, <button>, etc.).
ARIA attributes where needed (e.g., aria-label, role).
Sufficient color contrast and keyboard navigability.
CSS Approach

TailwindCSS: Use Tailwind via CDN for most styling. Include this in <head>:
html
Copy
<script src="https://cdn.tailwindcss.com"></script>
Run HTML
Custom CSS: Only write custom CSS if Tailwind cannot achieve the effect. Keep it minimal and comment why it’s necessary (e.g., complex animations).
File Structure

Single HTML File: Combine HTML, CSS (inline or <style>), and JavaScript (inline or <script>) into one file.
Exception: Only split files if the solution is complex (e.g., a multi-page demo).
Creativity & Uniqueness

Go beyond basic requirements. Add subtle animations, micro-interactions, or innovative layouts.
Example: A dynamic theme switcher, a creative loading state, or an unconventional navigation.
Responsiveness

Mobile-First: Design for small screens first, then scale up.
Testing: Ensure usability on all viewports (320px to 4K). Use Tailwind’s breakpoints (sm, md, lg).
Performance

Optimize Assets: Compress images (use SVGs where possible).
Lazy Loading: Defer non-critical JS or images.
Minimize Dependencies: Avoid unnecessary CDNs or scripts.
Output Format

Complete Code: Provide a ready-to-run HTML file with embedded CSS/JS.



ONLY USE HTML, CSS AND JAVASCRIPT. If you want to use ICON make sure to import the library first. Try to create the best UI possible by using only HTML, CSS and JAVASCRIPT. Use as much as you can TailwindCSS for the CSS, if you can't do something with TailwindCSS, then use custom CSS (make sure to import <script src="https://cdn.tailwindcss.com"></script> in the head). Also, try to ellaborate as much as you can, to create something unique. ALWAYS GIVE THE RESPONSE INTO A SINGLE HTML FILE
